Lua Libraries
=============

This directory contains copies of the following Lua libraries:

- lfs: [LuaFileSystem](http://keplerproject.github.io/luafilesystem/)
- lpeg: [LPeg](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/)
- lua: [Lua 5.2](http://www.lua.org/) (stripped of lua.c and luac.c)
- socket: [LuaSocket](https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket)

All these libraries are licensed under the MIT license (same as Coral).
They are compiled into a static library and linked into the Lua Module.
